# 2D_FISH_GAME
Project demonstrate 2D game using HTML5 and vanilla JavaScript . added sound to the game, to make player character follow the mouse whenever we click somewhere, to handle simple collision detection that triggers sprite animation and to rotate our fish sprite correctly to face the direction the player is moving. moreover cover repeating backgrounds, handle score and couple of other things. First I build a solid good quality game skeleton that can be used for more than just this particular fish game. besides start adding graphics with sprites, particle effects and make the game look polished and clean.
